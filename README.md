### **PermiGuard:PERMISSION BASED DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF ANDROID MALWARE FAMILIES WITH INTRUSION AWARENESS**

This application detects whether an apk contains malware or not. And if it does, then the family of malware to which it belongs and the permissions that can possibly cause intrusion is displayed. We used the Random Forest to detect whether an apk contains malware or not. If it contains malware then we used the Adaboost algorithm to detect its family. To detect permissions that can cause intrusion we used Isolation Forest

#### **Datasets**

The basic dataset was downloaded from the androzoo's official site named latest.csv. This dataset is not included in this repository so you can download it from the link: 
https://androzoo.uni.lu/static/lists/latest.csv.gz
. Since the original data size was too large, this dataset was reduced(latest1.csv) to contain only 1300 rows.
We created our original dataset sorted and unsorted details on which we trained and evaluated various machine learning algorithms.
